/**
 * This driver has not been implemented yet. I don't know how well
 * the deleting of registrants will work - if it works quite well,
 * then there will be no reason to implement this driver i.e.
 * we could just delete all the registrants by hand after
 * confirming their payment. 
 * 
 * Payment verification would work by checking the charge through
 * google checkout/check and easily figuring out which of
 * the registration rows is correct. We could also do this
 * by looking at the last row for that registrant.
