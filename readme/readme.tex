\sn{Hacking notes}
Note that according to Google, when you use the LineFeed to get information
from the spreadsheet, the first row will not be returned in that LineFeed.
This is because the first row is considered a header row and thus
contains no data. You can customize your query using a CellFeed query,
however, this takes more work on your part for processing the CellFeed.
