		Dear tangueros and tangueras,
<br/>
<br/>		We are so excited to have you participate in the 4th Terrapin Tango Festival!  Before the Festival, we would like to provide you with some information that will hopefully make transportation and access to the Festival easy for you. 
<br/>		______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
<br/>
<br/>		<b>Getting to the Festival</b>
<br/>
<br/>		All of the events for the Festival will take place at the Stamp Student Union at the University of Maryland, College Park.  Directions for getting to Stamp can be found here: <a href="http://thestamp.umd.edu/about_us/directions_to_stamp">Stamp Directions</a>.
<br/>
<br/>		If you are driving into the University after 10 pm, you will need to tell the guard that you are going to the Terrapin Tango Festival, and they will let you through.  This isn't necessary if you're driving onto campus at an earlier hour. 
<br/>
<br/>		<b>Parking </b>
<br/>
<br/>		The easiest parking will be in Lot 1.  In order to park here, please drive up Campus Drive (going uphill), you will pass Stamp on your right, keep driving straight, after you drive past the tennis courts on your right, you will see a large parking lot.  You can park anywhere in this large lot, unless there is a sign saying specifically that you cannot.  Any parking spots that are labeled as part of Lot 1 (a,b,c,d) are free from 4 pm on Friday until 7 am on Monday.  A map can be found at: <a href="http://www.studentorg.umd.edu/atc/site/festival/directions.html">Festival Directions</a>.
<br/>
<br/>		<b>Check-in</b>
<br/>
<br/>		Once you have successfully parked and walked to Stamp, please enter through the main entrance, off Campus Drive.  Volunteers in the lobby area will help you get checked in and direct you to your first class/event.  Please be prepared to present your e-ticket (in paper or on an electronic device) to enter each class or milonga.  Please leave yourself 15 extra minutes to guarantee that you check-in and get to your class on time. 
<br/>
<br/>		<b>Finding Your Classes/Milongas</b>
<br/>
<br/>		The classes will be in the Prince George's Room (PG room) and the Atrium. The milongas will be in the Atrium and the Colony Ballroom. The practica will be in the Atrium. The Festival schedule is available online at: <a href="http://www.studentorg.umd.edu/atc/site/festival/schedule.html">Festival Schedule</a>
. For more information about how to get to these rooms, please feel free to use the map of the building: <a href="http://www.stamp.umd.edu/visitorInfo/stampMap.html">Stamp Map</a>, or ask a volunteer. 
<br/>
<br/>		<b>Last Minute Reminders</b>
<br/>
<br/>		A volunteer will always be in the lobby of Stamp and will help you if you have any questions or get lost during the Festival. Volunteers will be wearing Volunteer name tags, so it should be easy to identify them. 
<br/>
<br/>		<b>Dinner Options</b>
<br/>
<br/>		If you're wondering where to go for dinner, please look here: <a href="http://www.studentorg.umd.edu/atc/site/festival/food.html">Food Locals</a>, and if you want more advice, ask a volunteer.
<br/>
<br/><b>Metal Detectors </b>
<br/>
<br/>Heads-up: due to new security rules, we will have metal detectors at the Saturday Grand Milonga, so please do not bring anything to set off the alarm.
